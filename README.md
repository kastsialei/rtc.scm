## RTC plugin for IDEA

> for all developers developing in *IDEA* and using *RTC* as version control, who want checkout and commit right in project context without installing Eclipse client for *RTC*.

**Features** : all features like in Eclipse client with restrictions and simplified functionality

**Benefits** : 
 - idea licensing for OS (?)
 - deep knowledge in *RTC* work

**No-functional Requirements** : plugin must be integrated as VCS plugin in *IDEA*, and standard buttons trigger corresponding action.

**Plan** : 

 - use git plugin as base for plugin
 - install plugin for idea from third side
 - *RTC* features learning
 - *base functionality* : update, commit and commit to remote repository
 - presentation about plugin features and *RTC*
